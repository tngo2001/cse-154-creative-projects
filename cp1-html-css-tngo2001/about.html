      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        Hello, my name is Thompson Ngo. I am a Freshman and a first-generation college
        student. I am also a direct admit to the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science &amp;
        Engineering for Fall 2020. My major is Computer Science (obviously) and I intend to minor
        in Mathematics, as well as Neural Computation and Engineering. During Summer break, I went
        to Louisiana to visit my grandmother, who got an injury from tripping (don't worry, she's
        doing well now). I have some prior experience with web development from taking
        <a href="https://www2.bellevuecollege.edu/classes/All/PROG/109">PROG 109 at Bellevue
        College</a>.
        I did many assignments in that class, one of my most notable assignments is
        <a href="about-rs.html">this one</a>.
        You can also access this via the navigation bar (it's called "Creative Project 1"). My other
        Creative Projects from CSE 154 (which have yet to be made or added) can be accessed this
        way too. Regarding CSE 154, what I am most excited about learning is SQL, as my previous
        web development did not cover that and I have very little experience in it.
