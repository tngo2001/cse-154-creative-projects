  This file is the file I have linked to my about page. It is an assignment I did in the past and
  basically, it is a website template.

<!--
  Note: The following code is copied (although it is somewhat modified to meet the requirements of
  this assignment) from an old assignment I did from when I took PROG 109 at Bellevue College. It
  is very likely that I got some inspiration from various online sources (although I don't think I
  copied anything exactly), however, my instructor did not require me to cite my sources,
  therefore, I have no way of finding the sources of my inspiration (if there were any).
